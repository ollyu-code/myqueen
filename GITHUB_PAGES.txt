Push to GitHub and turn on GitHub Pages
========================================

1. Create a new repo on GitHub
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: e.g. sandra or birthday (no spaces)
   - Public, no README (you already have files)
   - Create repository

2. Push your code (run these in the project folder)

   If your branch is "master" (Git default), rename it to "main" so Pages is happy:

     git branch -M main

   Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME with yours):

     git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

   Push:

     git push -u origin main

   Example: if your GitHub user is "Olly" and repo is "sandra":
     git remote add origin https://github.com/Olly/sandra.git
     git push -u origin main

3. Turn on GitHub Pages
   - On the repo page: Settings → Pages (left sidebar)
   - Under "Build and deployment":
     - Source: Deploy from a branch
     - Branch: main (or master)
     - Folder: / (root)
   - Save

4. Your site will be live at:
     https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/

   (It can take 1–2 minutes the first time.)

If you use GitHub’s own “Create repo” flow, it may show you the exact git remote add and git push commands to copy.
